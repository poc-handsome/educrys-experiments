A systemtic manual is provided in [manual](/crystal-growth-tin/manual) (TODO) while the sections below introduce a basic experiment.

## Preparing the hardware

- Switch on the EduCrys setup
- Adjust the clock on Raspberry Pi
- Start the GUI
- Check that all components are working
- Adjust the camera

## Preparing the experiment

- Prepare a 20x1 mm copper wire as a first artificial seed
- Place the seed holder (bottom) 100 mm above the crucible, set the Z position in the GUI

## Heating

- Use a recipe for a temperature ramp to 220 °C in 30 min, followed by a ramp to 234 °C in 15 min
- Remove the oxide from the surface several times with a stainless steel spoon

## Seed growth

## Crystal growth

## Cooling

## Finish

- Copy data files

## Analysis

- Measure crystal shape
- Plot process parameters
